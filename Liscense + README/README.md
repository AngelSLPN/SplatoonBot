This Program was Designed for users to host, modify, and use!
Just install python3.5 or newer and install the dependancies to get started!

Most of the Dependancies will be in the startup script _Bash the run.sh_
The Discord Library this bot uses is **Discord.py (Rewrite)** make sure to keep note of that!
You may get some issues upon booting the bot up like missing dependancies, if you found any please tell me!
If you want to get in touch with me or report on any errors just send me a message on discord (I am VeeMOE#2164) or [Join the Support Discord!](https://discord.gg/VnPuezs)
